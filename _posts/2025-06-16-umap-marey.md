The increasing availability of user data on music streaming platforms opens up new possibilities for analyzing mu-
sic consumption. However, understanding the evolution of user preferences remains a complex challenge, particu-
larly as their musical tastes change over time. This paper uses the dictionary learning paradigm to model user
trajectories across different musical genres. We define a new framework that captures recurring patterns in genre
trajectories, called pathlets, enabling the creation of comprehensible trajectory embeddings. We show that path-
let learning reveals relevant listening patterns that can be analyzed both qualitatively and quantitatively. This work
improves our understanding of users’ interactions with music and opens up avenues of research into user behavior and
fostering diversity in recommender systems. A dataset of 2000 user histories tagged by genre over 17 months, sup-
plied by Deezer (a leading music streaming company), is also released with the code.
