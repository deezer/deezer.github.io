Extensive works have tackled _Language Identification (LID)_ in the speech domain, however their application to
the singing voice trails and performances on _Singing Language Identification (SLID)_ can be improved leveraging recent progresses made in other singing related tasks. 

This work presents a modernized phonotactic system for SLID on polyphonic music: phoneme recognition is performed with
a _Connectionist Temporal Classification (CTC)-based acoustic model_ trained with multilingual data, before language
classification with a recurrent model based on the phonemes estimation. The full pipeline is trained and evaluated with a
large and publicly available dataset, with unprecedented performances. First results of SLID with out-of-set languages
are also presented.

This paper will be published in the proceedings of the [46th IEEE International
Conference on Acoustics, Speech and Signal Processing (ICASSP 2021)](https://2021.ieeeicassp.org/). 
It results from Lenny Renault's research internship at Deezer in 2020.
